# Setup
✏️ We are going to utilize Postman's Collection Runner feature --> the core function that makes
everything happen is the **postman.setNextRequest** function. 

#### Our first use case is using a single variable from a data file w/ a single API request (DELETE), to remove a large amount of service entry data within a Fleetio account.

**Required commands for our test script:**

This first example is going to be a *single, linear loop*; we'll be deleting a large series of vehicle service entries
through the Fleetio API - which supports a {{id}} specific DELETE endpoint in their API. 

`postman.setNextRequest("Request Name");`

while

`postman.setNextRequest(null);`

will terminate the execution of the iterative loop. 

### First: Create a Collection
Do this inside of your choosen environment.
(*Postman workspace setup and global variables not covered here but can be found here*) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wArvaHYdw2I

Once you have your collection created, we'll need to add the API call.  We are going to use a `DELETE` call to remove data at the /service_entry endpoint within Fleetio. 

**Setup your Headers:**
Follow https://developer.fleetio.com/docs/getting-started
```
Authorization: Token [your_API_key]
Account-Token: [string from your account]
Content-type: application/json
```

The easiest way to do this w/in your workspace is to set these as environment variables in whatever Postman workspace you are saving this collection. [Postman has great docs](https://learning.postman.com/docs/postman/variables-and-environments/variables/#variable-scopes) on the hierarchy of variables and the variable scope of each. Understanding variable scope is key to making sure your collection run works properly (which we'll get to next).
